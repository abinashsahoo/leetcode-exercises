* Here is the funny thing about BST. Inorder traversal is **not a unique identifier** of BST.
* At the same time both preorder and postorder traversals are unique identifiers of BST.
* BST: inorder = sorted(postorder) = sorted(preorder)
* (inorder + postorder) or (inorder + preorder) are both unique identifiers of whatever binary tree.
